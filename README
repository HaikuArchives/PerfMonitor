PerfMonitor v1.2
written by Steve Sprang

August 24, 1997

Introduction
============

PerfMonitor (Performance Monitor) is an X-style CPU monitor. It shows the 
load-history of each CPU as well as the RAM-utilization history for (approximately)
the previous minute. It's updated roughly every 2/3 seconds.


Usage
=====

To start using PerfMonitor simply launch the application. The program
will then start displaying the CPU histories.

Each CPU corresponds to a graph in the PerfMonitor window. CPU 0 is the
topmost graph, CPU 1 the second from the top, and so on.

Green lines indicate times when a CPU was "on" and red lines indicate
times when a CPU was "off". CPUs can be toggled on and off by clicking
in the corresponding graph. A disabled CPU will display a dimmed graph.

NOTE: PerfMonitor will not allow you to shut off a CPU if it is currently
the only active CPU. If you have need to shut down all processors (perhaps
to benchmark your app on a no-processor machine) Be provides a similar
program with this feature enabled called "Pulse".

* All graphs in the PerfMonitor window can be hidden/exposed by clicking
on the small blue toggle triangle immediately above the graph.

* A new type of graph was introduced with version 1.1. This graph
shows memory utilization. It is always the last graph in the window and
utilization is indicated by blue lines. 

* Version 1.2 now remembers the window position between launches
and also records the toggled state of each graph so that you don't need
to fiddle with it each time you launch it.


The Code
========

The (commented) source for PerfMonitor is provided. A few fragments of
code are based on sample code from Be (the aforementioned "Pulse").


License and Distribution
========================

PerfMonitor is currently being distributed as freeware. However, 
donations and/or job offers are welcome. ;)

Feel free to distribute PerfMonitor in any way that you can. I only ask 
that this package be left intact (i,e, the executable, source code,
and this README should stay together).

If you make any changes to the source code, please DO NOT distribute it
without first contacting me.
